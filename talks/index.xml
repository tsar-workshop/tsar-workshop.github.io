&lt;a href="http://www.victoriayaneva.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Victoria Yaneva&lt;/a> is a Manager, NLP Science at NBME (National Board of Medical Examiners, USA). With a BSc degree in Psychology from the University of Plovdiv, Bulgaria and a PhD in Natural Language Processing from the University of Wolverhampton, UK, Victoriaâ€™s interests lie in various intersection between these two disciplines. Her work includes research on text and web accessibility for people with autism and the use of eye tracking and machine learning for the automatic detection of autism in adults. At NBME, her work focuses on the use of NLP for educational assessment in the context of high-stakes clinical exams, where she explores applications such as automated scoring of clinical text, predicting item characteristics from item text, and automated item generation. She also conducts eye-tracking research on the way examinees interact with multiple-choice questions as a way to assess the process validity of clinical exams.
