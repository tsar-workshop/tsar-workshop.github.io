title: "Easy-to-understand Writing with AI Assistance"

summary: "Easy-to-understand language is not only needed by people with learning difficulties and disabilities. International studies show that many more people have difficulties understanding serious information from public authorities or companies. In this presentation we will introduce rules and criteria for easy-to-understand language and show some good examples from companies and public authorities. Since most people who are responsible for writing and providing information do not know how to write easy-to-understand texts, AI-based writing assistance can be very useful. In the talk, we will show how we can analyze and simplify complicated information very easily with an AI-based writing assistance."

**Abstract:**
Easy-to-understand language is not only needed by people with learning difficulties and disabilities. International studies show that many more people have difficulties understanding serious information from public authorities or companies.
In this presentation we will introduce rules and criteria for easy-to-understand language and show some good examples from companies and public authorities.
Since most people who are responsible for writing and providing information do not know how to write easy-to-understand texts, AI-based writing assistance can be very useful.
In the talk, we will show how we can analyze and simplify complicated information very easily with an AI-based writing assistance.
