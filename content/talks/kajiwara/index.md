title: "Controllable Text Simplification"

summary: "Text simplification is a task of paraphrasing a given text in an easy-to-understand manner to assist a variety of people in language comprehension. To fully benefit from text simplification, consideration of individual differences in language ability is crucial. Over the past decade, much effort has been devoted to studying methods for text simplification that adapt expressions according to the target audience. This presentation focuses on approaches to personalizing text simplification, specifically controlling readability and editing operations."
