## Camera-ready papers due: 07 October 2025 (11:59PM UTC-12:00 - “anywhere on Earth”).

### Formatting

Please use the official [ACL style templates](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files) (Latex and Word).
Please follow the paper formatting guidelines general to “*ACL” conferences available [here](https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html).
Authors should not modify these style files or use templates designed for other conferences.

### Length

Final versions are given one additional page of content so that reviewer's comments can be taken into account. So, **long papers** can have up to 9 pages while **short papers** can have up to 5 pages of content.
Unlimited pages are given for references.
Appendices must appear right after the References.

### Extra Space for Lay Summary

Similar to the last edition of TSAR, we are requesting authors of accepted papers to include a **lay summary** of their paper in the camera-ready version.
This lay summary should not be more than 400 words. Some guidelines on how to write a lay summary can be found [here](https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/85518309/plain-language-summaries-how-to-write-an-elife-digest).
Extra space is allowed after the 9th page (5th page for short papers) for a lay summary section.
This section should be titled **Lay Summary** and appear at the end of the paper, after the discussion/conclusions section and before the references.
